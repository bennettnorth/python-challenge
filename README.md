PyBank analyzes a CSV data set to calculate values related to Profit and Loss for a hypothetical dataset. It calculates total P&L, average change, and days with the greatest and smallest profit and loss.

PyPoll calculates voting data for a mock dataset. The code identifies the number of votes each candidate received, the percentage of the total vote, and identifies the winner.

Both datasets intake CSV files with an absolute path.
